# Butter
[Butter](http://butterurls.com/) is a Chrome extension that wipes utm codes tracking tokens and other unnecessary crap from URLs.

Why share an ugly URL that is packed with UTM codes and tracking tokens when you could share a URL with the word “butt” instead?

With [the Butter extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/butter/jllpdjjoodaanpjhanfppkaemlplcmom), you can wipe that crap away with the click of button. This cheeky extension replaces tracking tokens from a URL and replace them with the word “butts”. 

Once the Butter extension is installed and activated in your Chrome browser, it will light up when it detects that you are on a URL with a UTM code. Simply click on the Butter extension to copy a shortened URL to your clipboard.
